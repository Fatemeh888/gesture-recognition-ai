# Gesture Recognition with Artificial Intelligence

## ðŸ“– Project Description
This project focuses on the **recognition of human gestures** using Artificial Intelligence. It aims to develop a visually based, markerless system capable of identifying and interpreting human movements. The work involves several steps:

1. **Extraction of body keypoints** from human movements.
2. **Definition and annotation** of gestures.
3. **Segmentation of body keypoints** into temporal sequences.
4. **Storage of annotated sequences** in a CSV file to create a training dataset.

The dataset was then trained using various models, with the **CNN-LSTM model** yielding the best results.

## ðŸ›  Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
   - the required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file
- **Models:** 
  - RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM)

## ðŸš€ Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command: `git clone https://github.com/Fatemeh888/gesture-recognition-ai.git`.
2. **Change to the project directory:** Navigate to the directory: `cd gesture-recognition-ai`.
3. **Install dependencies:** Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. **Run the main script:** Start the system with `python extracting-body-keypoints.py`.

### Note:
Ensure that you have set up the **Python environment** correctly and that the required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## ðŸ“Š Training
The dataset was trained using various models, including RNN, LSTM, and **CNN-LSTM** (the model with the best results).
